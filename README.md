# FlightSimulatorAndroidApp



## Introduction

This repository documents my last project in Adanced Programming 2 course at Bar-Ilan university.
In this project I've implemented an Android app that allows the user to remotely control an aircraft in FlightGear simulator.

## System Requirements

1. Android device with Android 11.0 x86 OS (The program is likely to work on lower versions as well).
2. FlightGear simulator â€“ Download here: https://www.flightgear.org/download/



## Model, View, ViewModel

The program is devided according to MVVM architecture:

1. **Model**:     Holds data (client) and logic, sends commands to the flight simulator.
2. **ViewModel**: Acts as the link between the Model and View.
3. **View**:      Responsible for the visualization and creating displays for the user

## Instructions for running the app using Android Studio

1. Install FlightGear on your machine.
2. Open FlightGear, go to "settings", scroll down to "Additional Settings", then write: "--telnet=socket,in,10,127.0.0.1,6400,tcp". If port 6400 is occupied, you can enter any available port x.
3. Download FlightSimulatorAndroidApp project.
4. Open Android Studio and start an AVD - recommend to start **Pixel XL API 30**.
5. Start FlightGear simulator.
6. Build and run the project from Android Studio.
7. Enter your machine's IP adrress and port 6400 (or port x you chose before).
8. Touch (click) connect.
9. You can now control the simulator.

It is possible that your device's Anti-Virus will ask to scan the app because it isn't recognized in Play Store.
You can choose "DON'T SEND", trust me :)
