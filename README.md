In this project I've implemented an Android app that allows the user to remotely control an aircraft in FlightGear simulator.

## System Requirements

1. Android device with Android 11.0 x86 OS – Tested on Pixel XL API 30 emulator.
2. FlightGear simulator – Download here: https://www.flightgear.org/download/

## Model, View, ViewModel

The program is devided according to MVVM architecture:

1. Model:     Holds data (client) and logic, sends commands to the flight simulator.
2. ViewModel: Acts as the link between the Model and View.
3. View:      Responsible for the visualization and creating displays for the user
